\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}
A special thanks to my supervisor Dr Petros Aristidou. He always has a very insightful, high-level view of the field while he is also uncommonly detail oriented and understands the nature of the problems very well. More importantly, Dr Aristidou is an extremely caring and supportive supervisor that I could not have asked for more.\\

Collaboration is a valuable lesson that I have learnt, which is also a precious part of my undergraduate stage. I thank Sultan Alghamdi for never reserving his minds when I tried to seek for his help. I am glad that my research can help part of his doctoral subject. It was a very unique and rewarding experience for me.\\

I would like to thank Dr Zoran Ikonic. His passionate lecture (ELEC2540 Control Systems) and impressive experiment last year has enhanced my understanding of PI control.\\

I am greatly appreciative to Walter Roberson from MATLAB for helping me find the clue to solve the problem with plotting a 3D triangle surface plot without a clearly relationship between variables.\\

Lastly, I would like to thank other staffs and my fellow schoolmates in the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, without them, this project would not be finished smoothly: Anna de Jong, Nathan Smith, Zikang Qian and Al Dabashi.\\
