\section{Hypothesis} %5.1
The hypothesis in this chapter is basically based on the hypothesis in Section~\ref{section4.1}.  \\
 
One of the different hypothesis is that it has several delays here, i.e. delay ranges between 0.01 seconds and 0.21 seconds, and the step is 0.01 seconds.  \\

It allows having the similar hypothesis with Section~\ref{section4.1} because, in this chapter, it can be seen as an extension of last chapter. In the last chapter, Nordic system is tested in a low delay while, in this chapter, we increase the delay. \\ 

An important assumption to allow keeping other parameters the same when increasing the time delay is that a larger time delay declines the performance of Nordic grid.\\
