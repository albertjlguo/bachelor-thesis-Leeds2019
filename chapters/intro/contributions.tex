\section{Contributions} %1.3
The contributions of this thesis are summarised as follows:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item I built a communication layer on top of an existing Smart Grid simulator and design a centralised controller for stabilising the system.\\
  
  \item I researched situations that cause disturbances, including generators interruption, high time delays and blackout. I built a series of efficient models for analysing the performance of the system and remove any unacceptable results. After hundreds of manual data proofreading, these models has demonstrated superior analytical ability.\\
  
  \item I built an optimal controller for stabilising the frequency based on the centralised controller and the analytical models above. This optimal controller has demonstrated superior performance of restoring frequency when disturbances occur in the system.\\
