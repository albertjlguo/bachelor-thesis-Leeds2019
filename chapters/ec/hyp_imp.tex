\section{Hypothesis and Implement} %6.2
Referencing Figure~\ref{4_1_1_without2} in Subsection~\ref{subsection4.1.1}, we find one of the lowest point, as shown in the Figure~\ref{6_2_g9}, as our start point of Emergency Control. \\

We start the Emergency Control from the 9.76th second and use one of the acceptable tuning results, i.e. kp is 30.1 and ki is 0.1, in Chapter~\ref{Chapter4}. The aim of such hypothesises is to test the impact of time delay under the condition of Emergency Control. The simulation lasts for 360 seconds.\\
