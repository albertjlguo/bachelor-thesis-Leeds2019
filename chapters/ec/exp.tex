\section{Expected Outcome} %6.3

What triggers an alert state will disturb a power grid system and may~\cite{andersson2005causes} even blackout mojor grids in several areas while time delay will affect the stability of the control (Subsection~\ref{subsection5.4.1}).

In all, emergency control will be affected by time delay and the controller's stability will be weakened. Besides, due to an alert state, the system will be disturbed, thus the stability will be weakened again. I predict that there are less acceptable results for emergency control.
