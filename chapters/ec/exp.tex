\section{Expected Outcome} %6.3
Time delay disturbs the system. A faster controller be implemented for a larger time delay to eliminate the errors due to the time delay. We already have a detailed discussion in Chapter~\ref{Chapter5}. In all, emergency control should not change the conclusion on the impact of time delay although they have different start time and have different performance under the same tuning condition.\\
