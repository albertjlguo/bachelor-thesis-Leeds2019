\section{Implement} %4.3

One of the most important idea to implement the testing environment is to modularise the function (Figure~\ref{4_3_code1}). We modularised our functions in a python file so we can import them as a library and call them directly (Figure~\ref{4_3_code2}). Additionally, it is necessary to remove hardcoded parameters so it is easy to change the parameters like start time, end time, prepared folder address and the list of generators (Figure~\ref{4_3_code2}).

Another noteworthy detail is we need to keep two significant digits (Figure~\ref{4_3_code2}) for kp, ki and time delay. It provides an unified format that helps exporting data into analytical algorithms.

The script to generate the feasible kp-ki-td parameters is automatic and well documented (Figure~\ref{4_3_code2}).
